# Vitest Hanging Issue - Diagnostic Summary

## Executive Summary

**The tests are NOT hanging** - they are failing due to Bun-Vitest compatibility issues.

## Key Findings

### 1. Test Execution Times
- Individual test files complete in 1-7 seconds
- No timeouts observed (10-second timeout never triggered)
- Tests fail with specific errors, not due to hanging

### 2. Root Cause: vi.mock Incompatibility

The primary issue is that `vi.mock` hoisting doesn't work with Bun:

```javascript
// This fails in Bun runtime:
vi.mock("@/components/navigation/navbar", () => ({
  default: () => <div>Mock Navbar</div>,
}));
```

**Error**: `TypeError: vi.mock is not a function`

### 3. Test Results Summary

| Status | Count | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| ✅ Passing | 2 | `lib/inngest-standalone.test.ts`, `hooks/use-anthropic-auth.test.ts` |
| ❌ Failing | 8 | Tests using `vi.mock`, tests with missing imports |

### 4. Specific Issues

1. **vi.mock hoisting** - Doesn't work with Bun's module loading
2. **Missing logger import** - `lib/telemetry.test.ts` references undefined logger
3. **Module resolution** - Some exports not found (e.g., `useAudioRecorder`, `PerformanceTracker`)

## Why Tests Appear to Hang

When running `bun run test:unit`, the output may appear stuck because:
1. Many tests fail with errors
2. The error output is very large (400K+ characters)
3. The terminal may struggle to display all errors
4. Multiple processes may be spawned

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run tests individually** to isolate failures:
   ```bash
   bun vitest run lib/inngest-standalone.test.ts
   ```

2. **Use verbose reporting** to see progress:
   ```bash
   bun vitest run --reporter=verbose
   ```

3. **Kill orphaned processes** if needed:
   ```bash
   pkill -f vitest
   ```

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Replace vi.mock with manual mocks**:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of vi.mock, use:
   const mockNavbar = vi.fn(() => <div>Mock</div>);
   ```

2. **Use Bun's native test runner** for simple unit tests
3. **Fix missing imports** in failing tests
4. **Consider running React component tests with Node.js** instead of Bun

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for hanging processes
ps aux | grep -E "(vitest|bun|node)" | grep -v grep

# Run a simple test to verify setup
bun vitest run lib/simple-mock-test.test.ts

# Run with timeout to prevent actual hanging
timeout 30 bun run test:unit
```

## Conclusion

The Vitest tests are functioning but encountering compatibility issues with Bun, particularly around module mocking. The perceived "hanging" is actually rapid test failures with extensive error output. The solution involves either adapting tests to work with Bun's limitations or using Node.js for tests that require advanced mocking features.
