### 3. Exact Resolution Pathway
```bash
# Remaining Infrastructure Issues (Clear Solutions):

1. esbuild EPIPE Error Resolution:
   # Current status: Persists despite esbuild: false
   # Solution: Alternative test runner or dependency upgrade
   
2. Missing Dependencies:
   npm install next-auth critters web-vitals
   
3. Test Execution Commands (Post-Resolution):
   npm run test              # 270 test files
   npm run test:coverage     # Coverage generation
   npm run test:integration  # API & database tests
   npm run test:e2e         # End-to-end workflows
```
