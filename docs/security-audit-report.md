# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive security audit completed. No exposed production credentials found in the codebase.

## Audit Scope

Searched for:
- API keys and tokens
- Secrets and passwords
- Private keys
- Credentials
- Environment variables

## Findings

### ✅ No Production Secrets Exposed

All sensitive values found were:
1. **Test Data**: Mock passwords in test files (`src/schemas/forms.test.ts`)
2. **Schema Definitions**: Password field definitions for validation
3. **Documentation**: References to environment variable names
4. **Package Dependencies**: AWS SDK credential providers (normal dependencies)

### ✅ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `.env.local` is properly listed in `.gitignore`
   - All sensitive configs use environment variables
   - Clear documentation on required environment variables

2. **Authentication**:
   - GitHub OAuth properly implemented
   - Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
   - No hardcoded credentials

3. **API Keys**:
   - All API keys referenced via `process.env`
   - Proper validation schemas for environment variables

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Rotate the Inngest keys** shown in `.env.local` since they were selected/viewed
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** to scan for secrets before commits
3. **Use a secrets manager** for production deployments

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit `.env.local`** files
2. **Use environment-specific configs** for different environments
3. **Implement secret rotation** policies
4. **Add secret scanning** to CI/CD pipeline

## Security Checklist

- [x] `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [x] Environment variables for all sensitive data
- [x] Secure cookie settings for auth tokens
- [x] Proper OAuth implementation
- [ ] Pre-commit secret scanning
- [ ] CI/CD secret scanning
- [ ] Secret rotation policy

## Conclusion

The codebase follows security best practices with no exposed production credentials. The only action needed is to rotate the Inngest keys that were viewed during the audit.
