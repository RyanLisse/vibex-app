- Concurrent user support: 1000+

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_MODE=database|localStorage|dual
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_FALLBACK=true|false
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_SYNC=true|false
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTO_MIGRATE=true|false
DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
```

### Storage Modes

1. **database** (default) - PostgreSQL only
2. **localStorage** - Legacy browser storage
3. **dual** - Both systems with sync

## 📋 Migration Tools

### Available Commands

```bash
# Check migration status
GET /api/migration

# Start migration
POST /api/migration
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "config": {
    "conflictResolution": "AUTO_MERGE",
    "backupBeforeMigration": true,
    "validateAfterMigration": true
  }
}

# CLI migration
npm run migrate:data -- --user=user-123
```

## 🔄 Rollback Capability

### Backup Systems

1. **Pre-migration backups** - Automatic before any migration
2. **Redis cache backups** - 7-day retention
3. **Database snapshots** - Point-in-time recovery
4. **localStorage preservation** - Until explicitly cleared

### Rollback Process

1. Switch to localStorage mode via environment variable
2. Restore from backup if needed
3. Investigate and fix issues
4. Retry migration

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Monitor database performance metrics
2. ✅ Set up alerting for slow queries
3. ✅ Review and optimize database indexes
4. ✅ Plan user migration schedule
