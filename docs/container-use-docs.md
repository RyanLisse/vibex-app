## Introduction

### What is Container-Use?

Container-Use is an **open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** developed by Dagger that provides **isolated containerized development environments for AI coding agents**. It acts as a bridge between AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools) and containerized development environments, allowing each agent to work in its own isolated container and Git branch.

### The Problem It Solves

Container-Use addresses the **"agent chaos"** problem that occurs when scaling AI coding agents:

**Without Container-Use:**
- **"YOLO Mode"**: Running multiple agents in the same local environment leads to conflicts, overwritten files, dependency clashes, and system instability
- **"Prompt and Pray Mode"**: Using managed agent services creates a black box with no control, limited intervention capabilities, and dependency on external infrastructure

**With Container-Use:**
- **Isolated Environments**: Each agent gets its own fresh container in a dedicated Git branch
- **Controlled Parallelization**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Transparent Operations**: Complete visibility into what agents actually do vs. what they claim
- **Direct Intervention**: Ability to drop into any agent's terminal when needed

### Key Features
- ðŸ”§ **Isolated Development**: Each agent works in its own containerized environment
- ðŸ‘€ **Real-time Visibility**: Monitor all agent activity with `cu watch`
- ðŸŽ¯ **Direct Control**: Drop into any agent's terminal with `cu exec`
- ðŸ”„ **Git Integration**: Each environment backed by a Git branch for versioned history
- ðŸš€ **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents on different tasks simultaneously
- ðŸ”Œ **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any MCP-compatible agent

## Installation and Setup

# Optional: Add agent rules for better integration
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

#### Cursor Setup
Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "container-use": {
      "command": "cu",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": [],
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

#### Goose Setup
Add to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`:
```yaml
extensions:
  container-use:
    name: container-use
    type: stdio
    enabled: true
    cmd: cu
    args: [stdio]
```

## Basic Usage

### Core Commands

The `container-use` command is also available as `cu` for convenience:

```bash
# Watch all agent activity in real-time
cu watch

# Drop into an agent's container
cu exec <environment_name>

# Alternative: Watch using git log
watch git log --remotes=container-use --oneline --graph --decorate
```

### Git Integration Commands

```bash
# Review all commands used by agents
git log --remotes=container-use --notes

# Inspect code written by agents
git log --patch container-use/<environment_name>
git diff container-use/<environment_name>

# Check out agent's work to local repository
git checkout <environment_name> && git pull

# Merge successful work into main branch
git merge container-use/<environment_name>
```

### Basic Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Start monitoring (in a separate terminal)
cu watch

# Step 2: Ask your agent to perform a task
> "Create a simple Express.js server with a health check endpoint"

# Step 3: Review the agent's work
git branch -r | grep container-use
git checkout container-use/<environment_name>

# Step 4: Merge if satisfied
git checkout main
git merge container-use/<environment_name>
```

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Agent Execution

Run multiple agents simultaneously on different tasks:

```bash
# Agent 1: Backend refactoring
> "Refactor the user authentication service using best practices"

# Agent 2: Frontend updates (simultaneously)
> "Upgrade all frontend npm packages to their latest stable versions"

# Agent 3: Documentation
> "Generate API documentation from the codebase"
```

### Direct Intervention

When an agent needs help or gets stuck:

```bash
# Drop into the agent's terminal
cu exec <environment_name>

# Or connect directly to the container
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

### Environment Variables and Configuration

Container-Use integrates with Dagger under the hood and supports various environment configurations:

```bash
# Custom environment variables can be passed through MCP configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "container-use": {
      "command": "cu",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Feature Development

Have multiple agents work on different features simultaneously:

```bash
# Agent 1: Implement user authentication
# Agent 2: Build dashboard components
# Agent 3: Create API endpoints
```

### 2. A/B Testing Implementations

Test different approaches to the same problem:

```bash
# Create two Flask implementations
> "Create a REST API using Flask with SQLAlchemy"

# Create a FastAPI alternative
> "Create the same REST API using FastAPI with async support"
```

### 3. Dependency Updates

Safely test package updates without affecting the main codebase:

```bash
> "Update all npm packages to latest versions and run tests"
```

### 4. Multi-Version Testing

Test your application against different runtime versions:

```bash
> "Test the application with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11"
```

### 5. Code Refactoring

Explore different refactoring approaches:

```bash
> "Refactor the authentication module to use dependency injection"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Task Design

- **Start Small**: Begin with focused, well-defined tasks
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, actionable instructions to agents
- **Incremental Development**: Build complex features incrementally

### 2. Resource Management

```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats

# Clean up unused containers and images
docker system prune

# Remove specific agent branches after merging
git branch -D container-use/<environment_name>
```

### 3. Workflow Organization

- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names for different agent tasks
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review agent work using `git log`
- **Documentation**: Keep track of what each agent is working on

### 4. Security Considerations

- **Container Isolation**: Each agent runs in its own secure container
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate CPU and memory limits
- **Access Control**: Agents cannot access the host system directly
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of agent actions via Git

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Execution**: Leverage multiple agents for independent tasks
- **Caching**: Dagger's intelligent caching speeds up repeated operations
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Regularly clean up completed agent environments
