# Agent Setup Validation

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete

The remote environment has been configured for agentic coding tools with the following components:

### üìÅ Files Created/Updated

1. **AGENTS.md** - Quick reference guide for AI agents
   - Essential commands and project overview
   - Testing stack and architecture summary
   - Key configuration files reference

2. **SETUP.sh** - Automated setup script
   - Detects package manager (Bun/npm/yarn)
   - Installs dependencies with error handling
   - Configures development environment
   - Verifies setup integrity

3. **.env.example** - Environment variables template
   - Documents all required environment variables
   - Includes AI service configurations
   - GitHub integration settings

4. **.gitignore** - Updated ignore patterns
   - Agent-specific directories (.claude/, .cursor/, etc.)
   - Testing artifacts and reports
   - Temporary and cache files

5. **Makefile** - Common development tasks
   - Simplified commands for agents
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Quality and testing shortcuts

## üîß Agent Capabilities Enabled

### Immediate Understanding
- **Project Type**: Next.js 15 with comprehensive testing
- **Package Manager**: Bun (primary), npm/yarn fallback
- **Architecture**: App Router + RSC, TailwindCSS, Zustand

### One-Command Setup
```bash
./SETUP.sh  # Complete environment setup
```

### Quick Development
```bash
make dev     # Start development server
make test    # Run all tests
make quality # Full quality check
```

### Testing Stack Ready
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Component**: Storybook with interactions
- **E2E**: Playwright (multi-browser)
- **Coverage**: 80% thresholds configured

### Code Quality Automation
- **Formatting**: Biome.js auto-formatting
- **Linting**: Strict TypeScript + Biome rules
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit quality gates
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline

## üöÄ Agent Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Run `./SETUP.sh` once
2. **Development**: Use `make dev` or `bun run dev`
3. **Testing**: Use `make test` for full validation
4. **Quality**: Use `make quality` before commits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Steps Required

1. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI features
   - `BROWSERBASE_*` for Stagehand testing (optional)
   - `GITHUB_*` for GitHub integration (optional)

2. **Playwright Setup**: Run `bunx playwright install` for browser binaries

3. **Git Hooks**: Run `bunx husky install` to activate quality gates

## üß™ Validation Commands

```bash
# Test the setup
./SETUP.sh

# Verify all systems
make ci

# Check specific components
bun run type-check  # TypeScript validation
bun run test:unit   # Unit tests only
bun run test:e2e    # E2E tests only
bun run quality     # Full quality check
```

## üìä Expected Results

- ‚úÖ 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive test suite
- ‚úÖ Sub-second build times with Turbopack
- ‚úÖ Auto-formatting and linting on save
- ‚úÖ Multi-browser E2E testing capability
- ‚úÖ AI-powered testing with Stagehand
- ‚úÖ Component development with Storybook

The environment is now optimized for AI agents to understand, setup, and develop efficiently!
