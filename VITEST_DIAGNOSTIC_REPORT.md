# Vitest Diagnostics Report

## Summary

The Vitest tests are **not hanging** - they are failing due to compatibility issues between Vitest, Bun, and the test code. The main issues are:

1. **Configuration error in vitest.config.ts** - Critical issue found!
2. **vi.mock incompatibility with Bun when hoisted**
3. **Missing dependencies in test environment**
4. **Module resolution errors**

## Critical Finding

The `vitest.config.ts` has an incorrect configuration that prevents tests from running:
```javascript
server: {
  deps: {
    inline: false, // ❌ This should be an array!
  }
}
```

This causes the error: `TypeError: resolved.server.deps.inline.push is not a function`

The configuration was changed from an array to `false` which breaks Vitest's internal dependency handling.

## Test Results

### Passing Tests ✅
- `lib/inngest-standalone.test.ts` - 3.9s
- `hooks/use-anthropic-auth.test.ts` - 3.5s
- Most unit tests in `src/` directory

### Failing Tests ❌

| Test File | Duration | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `lib/telemetry.test.ts` | 5.9s | Missing logger import |
| `app/client-page.test.tsx` | 1.2s | vi.mock not a function |
| `app/container.test.tsx` | 1.2s | vi.mock not a function |
| `app/layout.test.tsx` | 1.2s | vi.mock not a function |
| `app/page.test.tsx` | 1.8s | vi.mock not a function |
| `hooks/use-anthropic-auth-refactored.test.ts` | 3.6s | vi.mock not a function |
| `hooks/use-audio-recorder.test.ts` | 3.8s | Export not found |
| `hooks/use-auth-base.test.ts` | 6.6s | vi.mock not a function |

## Root Causes

### 1. vi.mock Incompatibility
```javascript
// This pattern fails in Bun:
vi.mock("@/components/navigation/navbar", () => ({
  default: () => <div>Mock</div>,
}));
```

**Error**: `TypeError: vi.mock is not a function`

This happens because Bun's test runner conflicts with Vitest's mocking system. The `vi.mock` hoisting that Vitest performs doesn't work correctly in Bun's runtime.

### 2. Missing Logger in Telemetry Tests
```javascript
// lib/telemetry.ts
logger.info("Telemetry configuration", {...}); // logger is undefined
```

The logger module is not properly imported or mocked in the test environment.

### 3. Module Resolution Issues
- `Export named 'useAudioRecorder' not found`
- `Export named 'Inter' not found in module`
- `export 'PerformanceTracker' not found`

These indicate problems with ES module resolution or missing exports.

## Configuration Analysis

The current Vitest configuration has:
- **Pool**: `forks` with `singleFork: true` - Good for stability
- **Environment**: `jsdom` - Properly configured
- **Globals**: `true` - Should enable vi.mock
- **Timeouts**: Reasonable (8s test, 3s hook, 2s teardown)

## Performance Observations

- Tests are not hanging (no timeouts observed)
- Individual test files complete in 1-7 seconds
- Total test suite completes but with many failures

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix vi.mock Issues
- Consider using manual mocks instead of vi.mock
- Or switch to a different test runner that's more compatible with Bun
- Or use conditional mocking based on the runtime

### 2. Fix Missing Dependencies
- Add proper imports for logger in telemetry.ts
- Ensure all exports are correctly defined
- Check for circular dependencies

### 3. Test Isolation
- Run tests in smaller batches to identify specific failures
- Use `--no-threads` or `--pool=forks` for better isolation

### 4. Alternative Approaches
- Consider using Bun's native test runner for simple unit tests
- Keep Vitest for complex integration tests that need its features
- Split test suites by compatibility requirements

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (will show failures)
bun run test:unit

# Run specific passing test
bun vitest run lib/inngest-standalone.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
bun vitest run --reporter=verbose

# Run with forks pool (more stable)
bun vitest run --pool=forks

# Run with coverage
bun vitest run --coverage
```

## Conclusion

The tests are **not hanging** - they're failing fast due to compatibility issues. The main problem is the incompatibility between Bun's runtime and Vitest's mocking capabilities, particularly `vi.mock`. This needs to be addressed by either:

1. Refactoring tests to not use vi.mock
2. Using a different test strategy for Bun
3. Running certain tests with Node.js instead of Bun
