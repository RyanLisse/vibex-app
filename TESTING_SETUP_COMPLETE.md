- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `@playwright/test` - E2E testing framework
- `@browserbasehq/stagehand` - AI-powered browser automation

### âœ… Configuration Files Created
- `vitest.config.ts` - Unit testing configuration with coverage thresholds
- `playwright.config.ts` - E2E testing configuration with multiple browsers
- `.storybook/main.ts` - Enhanced with proper Next.js integration
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Global test setup with mocks and utilities
- `src/test/test-utils.tsx` - Custom render functions and helpers

### âœ… Complete Feature Template
- **TDD Example**: Complete example-feature with full TDD workflow
- **Types & Schemas**: TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
- **Components**: Fully tested React components with stories
- **Utilities**: Helper functions with comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step TDD implementation guide

### âœ… Testing Scripts Available
```bash
# Unit & Integration Tests
bun test                 # Run all tests
bun test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode
bun test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report
bun test:ui             # Run tests with UI

# E2E Tests
bun test:e2e            # Run E2E tests
bun test:e2e:headed     # Run E2E tests with browser UI
bun test:e2e:debug      # Run E2E tests in debug mode

# Storybook
bun storybook           # Start Storybook dev server
bun test-storybook      # Run Storybook tests

# Quality Checks

## ðŸ“š Documentation Created

1. **`docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive testing guide
2. **`src/features/example-feature/TDD_EXAMPLE.md`** - Complete TDD workflow
3. **`src/features/example-feature/README.md`** - Feature template documentation

## ðŸŽ“ TDD Workflow Established

The project now includes a complete TDD example demonstrating:
1. **Red Phase** - Writing failing tests first
2. **Green Phase** - Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase** - Improving code while keeping tests green

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. **Run the tests**: `bun test src/features/example-feature/utils/example-utils.test.ts --run`
2. **View Storybook**: `bun storybook` then visit http://localhost:6006
3. **Check coverage**: `bun test:coverage` then open `coverage/index.html`
4. **Follow the TDD guide**: Use the example feature as a template for new features

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits Achieved

- âœ… **Fast Feedback** - Tests run quickly during development
- âœ… **High Confidence** - Comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… **Better Design** - TDD encourages modular, testable code
- âœ… **Regression Prevention** - Automated testing catches issues early
- âœ… **Documentation** - Tests serve as living documentation
- âœ… **Team Standards** - Consistent testing patterns across features

The testing framework is now ready for development! ðŸš€
