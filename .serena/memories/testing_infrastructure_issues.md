# Critical Testing Infrastructure Issues

## Current Problems
1. **Test Suite Hangs**: `make test-all` times out after 2 minutes
2. **Multiple Config Files**: 15+ test config files causing conflicts
3. **Mixed Test Runners**: Bun, Vitest, Jest, Playwright conflicts
4. **TypeScript Compilation Issues**: Hanging compiler bug

## Test Commands Status
- ❌ `make test-all` - HANGS/TIMES OUT
- ❌ `bun run test` - May hang due to TypeScript bug
- ✅ `bun run test:fast` - Works (30s, fast pre-push checks)
- ✅ `bun run test:safe` - Safe Vitest execution
- ✅ `bun run test:e2e` - Playwright E2E tests
- ⚠️ `bun run test:unit` - Legacy, use with caution

## Priority Fixes Needed
1. Resolve test suite hanging issues
2. Consolidate test configurations
3. Fix TypeScript compilation problems
4. Ensure 100% test pass rate
5. Verify test relevance and coverage
