# Architecture Refactoring Assessment System

A comprehensive code analysis tool designed to identify and prioritize refactoring opportunities in TypeScript/JavaScript codebases. This system analyzes code quality, detects dead code, identifies performance issues, and provides actionable recommendations for improving your codebase.

## Features

- **Code Quality Analysis**: Analyzes complexity metrics, detects anti-patterns, and validates TypeScript usage
- **Dead Code Detection**: Identifies unused imports, variables, unreachable code, and orphaned files
- **Performance Analysis**: Detects performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Architecture Analysis**: Evaluates modularity, coupling, and architectural patterns
- **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzes package dependencies and import optimization
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with prioritized recommendations and migration plans

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# The system is already integrated into the project
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage - analyze current directory
bun run analyze:architecture .

# Analyze specific directories
bun run analyze:architecture src lib

# Run all analysis types
bun run analyze:architecture --types=all src

# Save report to file
bun run analyze:architecture --output=report.json src

# Exclude patterns
bun run analyze:architecture --exclude="*.test.ts,*.spec.ts" src

# Enable strict mode (excludes low severity issues)
bun run analyze:architecture --strict src
```

### Available Analysis Types

- `code-quality`: Code complexity, anti-patterns, TypeScript issues
- `dead-code`: Unused imports, variables, unreachable code
- `redundancy`: Code duplication (placeholder)
- `performance`: Performance bottlenecks (placeholder)
- `architecture`: Architectural issues (placeholder)
- `dependency`: Dependency analysis (placeholder)
- `database`: Database schema issues (placeholder)

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { AnalysisEngine, AnalysisConfig } from './lib/architecture-refactoring';

const config: AnalysisConfig = {
  targetPaths: ['./src'],
  excludePatterns: ['node_modules', '*.test.ts'],
  analysisTypes: ['code-quality', 'dead-code'],
  strictMode: false,
  performanceThresholds: {
    maxAnalysisTime: 300000,
    maxMemoryUsage: 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
    concurrencyLimit: 4,
  },
};

const engine = new AnalysisEngine();
const results = await engine.analyzeCodebase(config);
const report = await engine.generateReport(results);
```

## Report Structure

The system generates comprehensive reports with:

### Summary
- Total issues found
- Critical issues count
- Estimated effort (hours)
- Risk assessment

### Categorized Issues
- Issues grouped by category (code-quality, dead-code, etc.)
- Severity levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Specific file and line information

### Prioritized Recommendations
- ROI-based prioritization
- Effort estimates
- Risk factors
- Dependencies between changes

### Migration Plan
- Phased approach (Quick wins → Core improvements → Major refactoring)
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates
- Rollback strategies

```

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular plugin architecture:

```
lib/architecture-refactoring/
├── core/                    # Core engine and infrastructure
│   ├── analysis-engine.ts   # Main orchestration engine
│   ├── plugin-manager.ts    # Plugin management system
│   ├── configuration.ts     # Configuration handling
│   ├── error-handler.ts     # Error recovery strategies

├── analyzers/              # Analysis plugins

    └── cli-runner.ts       # CLI implementation
```

## Extending the System

### Adding a New Analyzer

1. Create a new analyzer implementing the `AnalysisPlugin` interface:

```typescript
import { AnalysisPlugin, AnalysisContext, PluginResult } from '../types';

export class CustomAnalyzer implements AnalysisPlugin {
  name = 'CustomAnalyzer';
  version = '1.0.0';

  async analyze(context: AnalysisContext): Promise<PluginResult> {
    // Your analysis logic here
    return {
      pluginName: this.name,
      results: [],
      errors: [],
      warnings: [],
      metrics: {},
    };
  }
}
```

2. Register it in the plugin manager:

```typescript
// In plugin-manager.ts
this.registerPlugin('custom', new CustomAnalyzer());
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Processing**: Analyzers run with configurable concurrency
- **Caching**: AST parsing results are cached for performance
- **Memory Management**: Large files are processed with streaming when possible
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting for long analyses

## Limitations

- Currently supports TypeScript and JavaScript files only
- Some analyzers (redundancy, performance, architecture) are placeholders
- Requires TypeScript compiler API for full functionality
- Large codebases may require increased memory limits

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Complete implementation of all analyzers
- [ ] Add support for more languages (Python, Go, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Web-based visualization dashboard
- [ ] Automated fix application for simple issues
- [ ] Machine learning-based pattern detection
- [ ] Historical trend analysis

## Contributing

When contributing new analyzers or features:

1. Follow the existing plugin architecture
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation
4. Ensure performance impact is minimal
5. Add appropriate error handling
