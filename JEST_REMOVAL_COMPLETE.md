# Jest Removal Complete - Pure Vitest/Playwright Setup

## Summary
Successfully reverted the emergency Jest fallback implementation and restored a pure Vitest/Playwright testing framework.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Jest Dependencies
- ✅ Uninstalled `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- ✅ No Jest packages remain in package.json

### 2. Deleted Jest Configuration Files
- ✅ Removed all `jest.config.*` files (11 files)
- ✅ Removed all `jest.setup.*` files (3 files)
- ✅ Removed `emergency-jest.test.js`
- ✅ Removed `test-setup-jest-mocks.ts`

### 3. Updated Package.json Scripts
- ✅ Main test script uses Vitest: `"test": "vitest run"`
- ✅ No Jest-based test scripts remain
- ✅ All test scripts use Vitest or Playwright exclusively

### 4. Fixed Test Files
- ✅ Replaced all `jest.*` calls with `vi.*` equivalents
- ✅ Fixed imports from `{ jest }` to `{ vi }` in vitest
- ✅ Removed all `@testing-library/jest-dom` imports
- ✅ Updated VSCode settings to remove Jest extensions

## Current Testing Setup

### Unit/Integration Tests (Vitest)
```json
"test": "vitest run",
"test:watch": "vitest",
"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
"test:unit:components": "vitest run --config=vitest.config.ts",
"test:integration": "vitest run --config=vitest.integration.config.ts"
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```json
"test:e2e": "bunx playwright test",
"test:e2e:headed": "bunx playwright test --headed",
"test:e2e:debug": "bunx playwright test --debug"
```

## Verification
- No Jest references remain in configuration files
- Testing framework is purely Vitest (unit/integration) + Playwright (E2E)
- Vitest hanging issue resolution is maintained with optimized configuration
- All test commands use Vitest or Playwright exclusively

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all unit tests
bun test

# Run component tests
bun run test:unit:components

# Run integration tests
bun run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run all tests
make test-all
```

The emergency Jest fallback has been completely removed, and the project now uses a clean Vitest + Playwright testing setup.
