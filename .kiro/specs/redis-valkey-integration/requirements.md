# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Redis/Valkey integration to provide high-performance caching, session management, real-time communication, and distributed coordination for the ambient agent architecture. The integration will serve as a critical infrastructure component that enhances system performance, enables horizontal scaling, and provides essential services for agent coordination, user session management, and real-time features.

Redis/Valkey will complement the existing PostgreSQL + ElectricSQL database architecture by providing fast, in-memory data structures for temporary data, caching, and coordination primitives. The system will support both Redis and Valkey deployments, with Valkey recommended for long-term sustainability and open-source alignment while maintaining full Redis compatibility.
