# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive architecture analysis and refactoring assessment for the CloneDx AI-powered code generation platform. The goal is to systematically analyze, optimize, and modernize the codebase to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience while maintaining system reliability and extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality Analysis and Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and best practices, so that I can efficiently contribute to and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing TypeScript/JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL identify code smells, anti-patterns, and violations of best practices
2. WHEN reviewing code complexity THEN the system SHALL provide maintainability metrics and recommendations
3. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent patterns across all modules
4. WHEN evaluating type safety THEN the system SHALL identify areas where strict TypeScript can be improved
5. IF inconsistent coding patterns are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific refactoring recommendations

### Requirement 2: Dead Code Elimination and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused code removed from the codebase, so that the system is cleaner and bundle sizes are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning imports THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused imports, variables, functions, and classes
2. WHEN analyzing code paths THEN the system SHALL find unreachable code blocks and redundant conditional statements
3. WHEN reviewing file references THEN the system SHALL locate orphaned files that are no longer referenced
4. WHEN examining commented code THEN the system SHALL remove commented-out code blocks that serve no documentation purpose
5. IF dead code is identified THEN the system SHALL provide automated removal recommendations with impact assessment

### Requirement 3: Redundancy and Duplication Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate code consolidated into reusable components, so that maintenance is simplified and consistency is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code patterns THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate code and extract them into reusable functions/components
2. WHEN reviewing API interactions THEN the system SHALL find redundant API calls, database queries, or similar operations
3. WHEN examining utility functions THEN the system SHALL consolidate similar helper methods
4. WHEN analyzing configuration THEN the system SHALL merge duplicate configuration files or environment setups
5. IF code duplication exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL provide extraction recommendations with shared abstraction proposals

### Requirement 4: Architecture and Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want the system architecture to be well-organized and follow established patterns, so that the codebase is scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing folder structure THEN the system SHALL analyze current organization and suggest improvements
2. WHEN examining component/module organization THEN the system SHALL review separation of concerns
3. WHEN analyzing design patterns THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to implement Factory, Observer, and other patterns
4. WHEN evaluating abstractions THEN the system SHALL suggest better abstraction layers and interface definitions
5. IF architectural inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL provide modular boundary recommendations

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to perform efficiently, so that users have a responsive experience and resource usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing algorithms THEN the system SHALL identify inefficient algorithms or data structures
2. WHEN reviewing React components THEN the system SHALL find unnecessary re-renders and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN examining memory usage THEN the system SHALL locate potential memory leaks or resource-management issues
4. WHEN analyzing database interactions THEN the system SHALL review query efficiency and caching strategies
5. IF performance bottlenecks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations with expected benefits

### Requirement 6: Dependency and Import Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized dependencies and imports, so that bundle sizes are minimized and build performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing package.json THEN the system SHALL identify unused dependencies
2. WHEN analyzing bundle composition THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce bundle size
3. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN the system SHALL optimize for tree-shaking
4. WHEN evaluating dependencies THEN the system SHALL suggest lighter alternatives to heavy dependencies
5. IF dependency optimization opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration recommendations with impact analysis

### Requirement 7: Database and Infrastructure Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database and infrastructure components optimized, so that the system scales efficiently and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing database schema THEN the system SHALL review table structures, indexes, and relationships
2. WHEN examining monitoring systems THEN the system SHALL evaluate metrics collection and observability patterns
3. WHEN reviewing authentication THEN the system SHALL assess session management and security patterns
4. WHEN analyzing migration files THEN the system SHALL ensure proper versioning and rollback capabilities
5. IF infrastructure improvements are needed THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Documentation and Reporting

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want detailed analysis reports and implementation guidance, so that refactoring efforts can be prioritized and executed effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a prioritized list of refactoring opportunities with impact assessment
2. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL include specific file-by-file recommendations for cleanup
3. WHEN architectural improvements are suggested THEN the system SHALL provide implementation steps and migration paths
4. WHEN performance optimizations are identified THEN the system SHALL include expected benefits and measurement criteria
5. IF multiple refactoring options exist THEN the system SHALL provide trade-off analysis and recommendation rationale
