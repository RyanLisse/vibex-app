# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive structured logging system using Winston as the primary logging framework, integrated with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing correlation and designed to support the ambient agent architecture. The system will provide centralized, searchable, and contextual logging across all application components including AI agents, database operations, API requests, and system events. The logging infrastructure will support multiple output formats, log rotation, performance monitoring, and seamless integration with external log aggregation platforms.

Drawing from enterprise logging best practices and modern observability patterns, this system emphasizes structured JSON logging, correlation IDs, contextual metadata, and intelligent log level management to provide comprehensive visibility into system operations while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements

3. WHEN logging across different components THEN the system SHALL maintain correlation ID consistency for end-to-end request tracing
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL include service name, version, environment, and deployment information in every log entry
5. IF correlation ID is missing THEN the system SHALL generate a new one and log a warning about the missing correlation context
6. WHEN integrating with OpenTelemetry THEN the system SHALL include trace ID and span ID in log entries for distributed tracing correlation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want contextual logging for AI agent operations, so that I can debug agent behavior, track decision-making processes, and monitor performance across different LLM providers.

4. WHEN agent performance metrics change THEN the system SHALL log performance data including response times, token usage, and success rates
5. IF agent operations exceed performance thresholds THEN the system SHALL log warnings with performance analysis and optimization suggestions
6. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL log decision context, confidence scores, and reasoning paths for audit and debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable log levels and filtering, so that I can control log verbosity in different environments and reduce noise while maintaining essential information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring logging THEN the system SHALL support standard log levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace) with environment-specific defaults
2. WHEN log level is set THEN the system SHALL only output logs at or above the configured level with consistent filtering across all components
3. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support component-specific log levels allowing fine-grained control over different system parts
4. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL default to 'info' level while development environments default to 'debug' level
5. IF log level changes at runtime THEN the system SHALL apply new levels immediately without requiring application restart
6. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL respect security policies and redact sensitive information regardless of log level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-aware logging, so that logging operations don't significantly impact application performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging high-frequency events THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous logging to prevent blocking the main application thread
2. WHEN log volume is high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent sampling to reduce overhead while maintaining representative coverage
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust logging verbosity to preserve application performance
4. WHEN logging errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle logging failures gracefully without crashing the application
5. IF logging performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and alerts about logging system health and performance
6. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL track logging overhead and provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want log rotation and retention management, so that I can control disk usage while maintaining appropriate log history for debugging and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs reach size limits THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate log files with configurable size thresholds and retention policies
2. WHEN log files are rotated THEN the system SHALL compress old files and maintain configurable number of historical files
3. WHEN retention period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically delete old log files while preserving critical error logs longer
4. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent logs and provide warnings about storage constraints
5. IF log rotation fails THEN the system SHALL continue logging to prevent data loss and alert administrators about rotation issues
6. WHEN compliance requires THEN the system SHALL support extended retention for audit logs with secure archival options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with external log aggregation platforms, so that I can centralize logs from multiple services and enable advanced search and analysis capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured for external platforms THEN the system SHALL support multiple output destinations including ELK stack, Splunk, Datadog, and cloud logging services
2. WHEN sending logs externally THEN the system SHALL format logs appropriately for each destination while maintaining structured data integrity
3. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL buffer logs locally and retry transmission with exponential backoff
4. WHEN log transmission fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local fallback logging to prevent data loss
5. IF external platform requirements change THEN the system SHALL support configurable output formats and field mappings
6. WHEN integrating with cloud services THEN the system SHALL support authentication, encryption, and compliance requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want request and API logging with security considerations, so that I can monitor API usage, debug issues, and maintain security while protecting sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are received THEN the system SHALL log request method, path, status code, response time, and user context
