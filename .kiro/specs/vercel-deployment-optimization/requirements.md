# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vercel Deployment Optimization feature aims to improve the reliability, performance, and efficiency of our application's deployment process on Vercel. By implementing automated deployment checks, optimizing build configurations, establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline with the Vercel CLI, and integrating Dagger's AI-powered self-healing capabilities, we will ensure consistent and successful deployments across all environments with intelligent failure recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automate Vercel deployments using the Vercel CLI integrated with Dagger, so that I can ensure consistent and reliable deployments with containerized reproducibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the deployment command THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Vercel using stored credentials
2. WHEN the deployment process starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
3. WHEN the deployment command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on deployment progress
4. WHEN a deployment completes THEN the system SHALL display deployment status and URL
5. WHEN the deployment runs THEN the system SHALL use Dagger containers for consistent build environments
6. IF a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to optimize build configurations for Vercel with Dagger containerization, so that deployments are faster, more efficient, and reproducible across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL use optimal Next.js build settings for Vercel within Dagger containers
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies for dependencies and build artifacts
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle sizes through code splitting and tree shaking
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize image and static asset handling
5. WHEN builds run in different environments THEN the system SHALL ensure identical results using Dagger containers
6. IF the build exceeds Vercel's resource limits THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for optimization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to implement AI-powered self-healing deployment pipelines, so that common CI/CD failures are automatically resolved without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment fails due to linting errors THEN the system SHALL automatically generate fixes using AI agents
2. WHEN a deployment fails due to test failures THEN the system SHALL analyze and attempt to fix the issues
3. WHEN the AI agent generates fixes THEN the system SHALL create pull request suggestions with the proposed changes
4. WHEN fixes are generated THEN the system SHALL validate the fixes by re-running tests and builds
5. WHEN multiple fix attempts are needed THEN the system SHALL iterate until issues are resolved or max attempts reached
6. IF the AI agent cannot fix an issue THEN the system SHALL escalate to human developers with detailed analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement deployment previews for pull requests with Dagger integration, so that changes can be reviewed in isolated environments before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a preview deployment using Dagger
2. WHEN a preview deployment is created THEN the system SHALL post the preview URL to the pull request
3. WHEN changes are pushed to a pull request THEN the system SHALL update the preview deployment
4. WHEN a preview deployment is active THEN the system SHALL provide a way to compare it with production
5. WHEN preview deployments run THEN the system SHALL use identical container environments as production
6. IF a preview deployment fails THEN the system SHALL block the pull request from being merged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement environment-specific configurations with secure secret management, so that each deployment environment has the appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific variables
2. WHEN configuring environments THEN the system SHALL provide a secure way to manage sensitive information
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL implement additional verification steps
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL ensure all required configurations are present
5. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically sync them to Vercel
6. IF environment configurations are missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated post-deployment verification with health checks, so that I can ensure the deployed application is functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run automated health checks
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify critical API endpoints are responding
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify database connections are working
4. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify authentication flows are functioning
5. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL test key user journeys end-to-end
6. IF any health check fails THEN the system SHALL provide an option to rollback the deployment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) support with Dagger modules, so that AI assistants can interact with the deployment pipeline using natural language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP is configured THEN the system SHALL expose Dagger deployment functions as MCP tools
2. WHEN an AI assistant connects via MCP THEN the system SHALL provide access to deployment operations
3. WHEN using MCP THEN the system SHALL support natural language deployment commands
4. WHEN MCP operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain full audit trails
5. WHEN MCP is used THEN the system SHALL enforce the same security and permissions as direct API access
6. IF MCP operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the AI assistant

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive observability and monitoring of the deployment pipeline, so that I can track performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments run THEN the system SHALL provide end-to-end tracing of all operations
2. WHEN the pipeline executes THEN the system SHALL track build times, test execution, and deployment duration
3. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and error context
4. WHEN AI agents operate THEN the system SHALL track their decision-making process and tool usage
5. WHEN deployments complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance metrics and reports
6. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest optimizations
