# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive metrics and visualization system using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboard visualization, specifically designed to monitor the ambient agent architecture, AI operations, and system performance. The integration will provide real-time metrics collection, custom dashboards, intelligent alerting, and deep insights into agent behavior, task orchestration, memory usage, and system health across the entire application stack.

Building upon modern observability practices and integrating with the existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure, this system will provide actionable insights for developers, operators, and stakeholders through customizable dashboards, proactive alerting, and comprehensive performance analytics tailored for AI-driven applications.
