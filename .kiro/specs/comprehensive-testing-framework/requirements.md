# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive testing framework for Next.js applications, incorporating modern tools and best practices including Vitest, Playwright, Storybook, Biome.js, and quality tools. The framework follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows and provides multiple testing layers (unit, component, integration, and end-to-end) with automated quality checks and CI/CD integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete testing setup with multiple testing layers, so that I can ensure code quality and catch bugs early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing framework is set up THEN the system SHALL support unit testing with Vitest
2. WHEN the testing framework is configured THEN the system SHALL support component testing with Storybook
3. WHEN the testing framework is initialized THEN the system SHALL support end-to-end testing with Playwright
4. WHEN the testing framework is implemented THEN the system SHALL support AI-powered testing with Stagehand
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality tools, so that I can maintain consistent code standards and catch issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code quality tools are configured THEN the system SHALL use Biome.js for linting and formatting
2. WHEN quality checks run THEN the system SHALL use Qlty CLI for comprehensive code analysis
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL enforce conventional commit standards with Commitlint
4. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks for quality validation
5. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TDD workflow support, so that I can write tests first and ensure better code design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following TDD workflow THEN the system SHALL support writing failing tests first
2. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL allow running tests in watch mode
3. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL maintain test coverage
4. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL integrate with Storybook for component testing
5. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL enable safe refactoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline integration, so that I can automate testing and deployment processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run all test suites automatically
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL validate code quality
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging
4. WHEN all checks pass THEN the system SHALL enable automatic releases with semantic versioning
5. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL generate test reports and artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and configuration, so that I can organize code efficiently and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a vertical slicing architecture
2. WHEN configuration files are set up THEN the system SHALL include all necessary tool configurations
3. WHEN features are developed THEN the system SHALL support feature-based organization
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use Bun for package management
5. WHEN VS Code is used THEN the system SHALL provide proper editor configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing utilities and fixtures, so that I can write effective tests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide testing utilities and helpers
2. WHEN creating component tests THEN the system SHALL include React Testing Library setup
3. WHEN writing E2E tests THEN the system SHALL provide page objects and fixtures
4. WHEN testing forms THEN the system SHALL support user interaction testing
5. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL integrate with Zod for schema validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated release management, so that I can focus on development while maintaining proper versioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commits follow conventional format THEN the system SHALL automatically determine version bumps
2. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL generate changelogs automatically
3. WHEN versions are bumped THEN the system SHALL update package.json and create git tags
4. WHEN releases are published THEN the system SHALL create GitHub releases
5. WHEN release process runs THEN the system SHALL skip CI for release commits
