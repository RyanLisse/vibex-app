# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current localStorage-based state management into a comprehensive database-driven architecture with real-time synchronization and multi-agent observability. The system will integrate Drizzle ORM with ElectricSQL for offline-first real-time sync, while adding comprehensive observability for AI agent interactions and workflow orchestration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent data storage that survives browser sessions and enables collaboration, so that my tasks, environments, and agent interactions are never lost and can be shared across team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or modifies tasks THEN the system SHALL persist data to a PostgreSQL database instead of localStorage
2. WHEN a user creates or modifies environments THEN the system SHALL store configurations in the database with full audit trail
3. WHEN the browser is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL restore all user data from the database
4. WHEN multiple users access the same workspace THEN the system SHALL sync data in real-time across all clients
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue working offline and sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time synchronization across all my devices and team members, so that changes are immediately visible everywhere without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task status changes on one client THEN all other connected clients SHALL receive the update within 100ms
2. WHEN an environment configuration is modified THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes to all subscribers immediately
3. WHEN an agent execution starts or completes THEN all clients SHALL see real-time status updates
4. IF a client goes offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes locally and sync when reconnected
5. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL resolve them using last-write-wins with conflict detection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive observability of all AI agent interactions, so that I can debug issues, optimize performance, and understand agent behavior patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent executes any action THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, input, output, and metadata
2. WHEN agent executions fail THEN the system SHALL capture error details, stack traces, and context for debugging
3. WHEN viewing the observability dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time agent activity, performance metrics, and execution timelines
4. WHEN analyzing agent performance THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated metrics, success rates, and bottleneck identification
5. IF an agent execution takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL alert users and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want time-travel debugging capabilities, so that I can replay agent executions and understand exactly what happened during any workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent execution completes THEN the system SHALL store a complete execution trace with all intermediate states
2. WHEN debugging an issue THEN users SHALL be able to replay any past execution step-by-step
3. WHEN viewing execution history THEN the system SHALL provide a timeline view with the ability to jump to any point in time
4. WHEN comparing executions THEN the system SHALL highlight differences between successful and failed runs
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL enable rollback to any previous consistent state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless migration from the current localStorage system, so that no existing data is lost during the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database integration is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate all existing localStorage data
2. WHEN migration runs THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and report any issues
3. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL continue working with the same user interface and behavior
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback and continue using localStorage until issues are resolved
5. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL remove localStorage data after confirming database persistence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced workflow orchestration with persistent state, so that complex multi-step agent workflows can be reliably executed and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is defined THEN the system SHALL store the definition in the database with versioning
2. WHEN a workflow executes THEN the system SHALL track each step's state and enable pause/resume functionality
3. WHEN workflow execution fails THEN the system SHALL enable restart from the last successful checkpoint
4. WHEN viewing workflow status THEN users SHALL see real-time progress, current step, and estimated completion time
5. IF a workflow is interrupted THEN the system SHALL preserve state and allow continuation when conditions are restored

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agent memory and context sharing, so that agents can learn from previous interactions and maintain context across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL store learned context and patterns for future use
2. WHEN an agent starts a new task THEN the system SHALL provide relevant historical context and similar past executions
3. WHEN agents interact with the same codebase THEN the system SHALL enable knowledge sharing between different agent sessions
4. WHEN searching agent memory THEN the system SHALL support semantic search using vector embeddings
5. IF agent context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL automatically summarize and archive older interactions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive telemetry and monitoring, so that I can ensure system health and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL emit OpenTelemetry traces for all database operations and agent interactions
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics on query performance, sync latency, and agent execution times
3. WHEN viewing system health THEN administrators SHALL see real-time dashboards with key performance indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically capture context and enable correlation across distributed components
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and recommendations for optimization
