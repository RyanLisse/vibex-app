# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive ambient agent visualization system using React Flow to provide interactive, real-time monitoring and management of AI agent workflows. Drawing inspiration from LangChain's ambient agents concept and modern observability platforms, this system transforms traditional chat-based AI interactions into event-driven, autonomous agent orchestration with rich visual feedback. The system will integrate seamlessly with the existing Claude Flow integration and database observability infrastructure to provide a unified view of multi-agent operations, task dependencies, and system health.

Ambient agents operate continuously in the background, responding to events, infrastructure changes, and system signals without requiring direct human prompting. This visualization system makes these invisible operations visible, providing developers with powerful tools to monitor, debug, and optimize their ambient agent workflows.
