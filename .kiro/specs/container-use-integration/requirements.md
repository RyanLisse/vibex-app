# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Modal Labs cloud computing platform into the existing Next.js application to provide isolated serverless environments for AI coding agents. The integration enables parallel agent execution, Git-based workflows, and comprehensive task management with real-time monitoring and automated PR creation. Modal provides web-compatible containerized isolation without requiring local Docker setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated sandbox environments for each AI agent task, so that multiple agents can work simultaneously without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Modal is configured THEN the system SHALL provide isolated serverless functions for each agent task
2. WHEN an agent starts a task THEN the system SHALL create a fresh Modal environment with project dependencies
3. WHEN multiple agents run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent environment conflicts through Modal's isolation
4. WHEN agents install dependencies THEN the system SHALL isolate package installations within each Modal function
5. WHEN agents run tests or builds THEN the system SHALL execute them in isolated Modal environments without affecting the web application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel agent execution capabilities, so that I can have multiple agents working on different features simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tasks are created THEN the system SHALL spawn separate agent instances in parallel Modal functions
2. WHEN agents work on different features THEN the system SHALL allow simultaneous development without interference
3. WHEN agents need to resolve conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide Git-based merge conflict resolution
4. WHEN monitoring parallel agents THEN the system SHALL display real-time status of all active Modal functions
5. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN the system SHALL handle parallel PR creation and management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Git-based workflows with worktrees for agent tasks, so that all work is versioned and can be reviewed through standard Git processes with parallel development support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent task starts THEN the system SHALL create a new Git branch and worktree for isolated development
2. WHEN agents make changes THEN the system SHALL commit work incrementally with descriptive messages in their dedicated worktree
3. WHEN multiple agents work simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use separate worktrees to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically create pull requests from the agent's branch
5. WHEN reviewing agent work THEN the system SHALL provide standard Git diff and history views across worktrees
6. WHEN merging agent work THEN the system SHALL integrate changes through standard PR workflows and clean up worktrees

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want task creation from multiple sources, so that I can initiate agent work from issues, PR comments, and voice commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub issues are created THEN the system SHALL allow automatic task creation from issue descriptions
2. WHEN PR comments mention tasks THEN the system SHALL create agent tasks from comment instructions
3. WHEN voice commands are given THEN the system SHALL transcribe and create tasks from voice input
4. WHEN screenshots are provided THEN the system SHALL create bug fix tasks from visual feedback
5. WHEN tasks are created THEN the system SHALL validate and queue them for agent execution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and progress tracking, so that I can oversee all agent activities and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are working THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring through Modal dashboard and web interface
2. WHEN reviewing progress THEN the system SHALL display task status, completion percentage, and current activities
3. WHEN intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL allow direct access to Modal function logs and debugging
4. WHEN monitoring multiple agents THEN the system SHALL provide consolidated dashboard view
5. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports and logs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PR status tracking and management, so that I can review and merge agent-generated work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PRs are created by agents THEN the system SHALL track PR status and CI/CD pipeline results
2. WHEN reviewing PRs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diffs and change summaries
3. WHEN PRs need updates THEN the system SHALL allow iterative improvements through agent feedback
4. WHEN PRs are ready THEN the system SHALL facilitate automated or manual merge processes
5. WHEN PRs are merged THEN the system SHALL clean up associated containers and branches

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline integration, so that agent work is automatically tested and validated before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent PRs are created THEN the system SHALL trigger automated CI/CD pipelines
2. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL validate agent work against existing test suites
3. WHEN quality checks run THEN the system SHALL enforce code quality standards on agent contributions
4. WHEN CI fails THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to agents for iterative improvements
5. WHEN CI passes THEN the system SHALL mark PRs as ready for review and potential auto-merge

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Modal integration with existing tools, so that Modal-based isolation works seamlessly with Claude, Cursor, and other AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Modal integration THEN the system SHALL integrate Modal Labs SDK with existing Next.js application
2. WHEN agents connect THEN the system SHALL provide Modal serverless capabilities through API endpoints
3. WHEN using different AI tools THEN the system SHALL support Claude, Cursor, Goose, and other AI agents through web APIs
4. WHEN agents request environments THEN the system SHALL provision Modal functions through REST/GraphQL APIs
5. WHEN agent sessions end THEN the system SHALL properly clean up Modal function resources and billing
