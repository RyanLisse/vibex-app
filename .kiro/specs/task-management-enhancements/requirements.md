# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing task management system with advanced capabilities including visual bug reporting with screenshots, voice-dictated task creation, real-time task progress monitoring, kanban board visualization, and integrated PR status review. The enhancement aims to streamline development workflows by providing multiple input methods and comprehensive task tracking capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to report bugs quickly with screenshots, so that I can efficiently document visual issues without lengthy descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a "Quick Bug Report" button THEN the system SHALL capture a screenshot of the current screen
2. WHEN a screenshot is captured THEN the system SHALL open a bug report form with the screenshot attached
3. WHEN a user submits a bug report THEN the system SHALL create a new task with the screenshot and description
4. IF a user wants to annotate the screenshot THEN the system SHALL provide basic drawing tools (arrows, text, highlights)
5. WHEN a bug report is created THEN the system SHALL automatically tag it as "bug" and set appropriate priority

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create tasks using voice dictation, so that I can quickly capture ideas without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a voice input button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio
2. WHEN audio recording is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing recording status
3. WHEN a user stops recording THEN the system SHALL transcribe the audio to text
4. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL populate the task creation form with the transcribed text
5. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL provide an error message and allow manual text input
6. WHEN voice-created tasks are saved THEN the system SHALL tag them as "voice-created"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to monitor task progress in real-time, so that I can track team productivity and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the task monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators
2. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators without page refresh
3. WHEN a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL highlight it with warning indicators
4. IF a task has been in progress for too long THEN the system SHALL flag it as potentially blocked
5. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL show completion percentages and time estimates
6. WHEN multiple users are working THEN the system SHALL show individual contributor progress

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to visualize tasks in a kanban board format, so that I can better understand workflow and task distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the kanban view THEN the system SHALL display tasks in columns by status
2. WHEN a user drags a task between columns THEN the system SHALL update the task status
3. WHEN tasks are moved THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically
4. IF a column has too many tasks THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for overload
5. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by assignee, priority, or tags
6. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time across all users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review PR status within the task management interface, so that I can track code review progress without switching tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is linked to a PR THEN the system SHALL display PR status information
2. WHEN PR status changes THEN the system SHALL update the task automatically
3. WHEN viewing PR status THEN the system SHALL show review comments, approvals, and merge conflicts
4. IF a PR is ready to merge THEN the system SHALL notify the task assignee
5. WHEN a PR is merged THEN the system SHALL automatically update the related task status
6. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL provide quick links to associated PRs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate shadcn components from external registries, so that I can quickly add pre-built UI components to enhance the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the screenshot feature THEN the system SHALL use the comp-547 component from originui.com
2. WHEN implementing AI features THEN the system SHALL use components from kibo-ui.com/registry/ai.json
3. WHEN implementing the kanban board THEN the system SHALL use components from kibo-ui.com/registry/kanban.json
4. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with existing design system
5. IF component integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback UI elements
6. WHEN components are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessible and responsive
