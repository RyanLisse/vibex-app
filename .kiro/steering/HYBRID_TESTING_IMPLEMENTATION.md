# Hybrid Testing Framework Implementation Summary

## Overview

The hybrid testing framework has been successfully implemented according to the specifications in `.kiro/specs/hybrid-testing-framework/`. This implementation separates testing concerns by using the most appropriate test runner for each type of test.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Bun Test Configuration (`bunfig.toml`)**
   - Configured for logic/utility tests only
   - Includes specific test file patterns
   - Excludes React components and integration tests
   - Coverage reporting to `coverage/bun-logic/`

2. **Vitest Unit Configuration (`vitest.unit.config.ts`)**
   - Created for React component testing
   - Uses jsdom environment
   - Configured with React Testing Library
   - Coverage reporting to `coverage/components/`

3. **Vitest Integration Configuration (`vitest.integration.config.ts`)**
   - Already existed and verified
   - Configured for API routes, database, and Inngest testing
   - Uses Node.js environment with jsdom
   - Coverage reporting to `coverage/integration/`

4. **Test Setup Files**
   - `bun-test-setup.ts`: Global setup for Bun tests
   - `vitest-setup.js`: Global setup for Vitest with jest-dom
   - `tests/setup/integration-setup.ts`: Integration test utilities

5. **Package.json Scripts**
   - Updated all test scripts for hybrid execution
   - Added separate scripts for each test type
   - Implemented coverage merge functionality

6. **Coverage Merge Script**
   - `scripts/merge-coverage.js`: Merges coverage from all test runners
   - Generates unified coverage report in `coverage/final-report/`

7. **AI Testing Utilities**
   - `lib/ai/models.test.ts`: Mock AI models for deterministic testing
   - Includes streaming response simulation
   - Provides consistent test responses

8. **Centralized Test Organization**
   - `all-tests/` directory structure created
   - Clear separation of test types
   - Documentation for test execution

## Test Runner Separation

### Bun Test Runner
- **Files**: `lib/**/*.test.ts` (specific utility files only)
- **Environment**: happy-dom (lightweight)
- **Use Cases**: Pure functions, utilities, schemas
- **Advantages**: Fast execution, native TypeScript support

### Vitest Component Tests
- **Files**: `**/*.test.{jsx,tsx}` (React components)
- **Environment**: jsdom (full DOM)
- **Use Cases**: React components, hooks with JSX
- **Advantages**: React Testing Library integration

### Vitest Integration Tests
- **Files**: Integration patterns, API routes, Inngest
- **Environment**: Node.js with jsdom
- **Use Cases**: API testing, database operations, workflows
- **Advantages**: Proper async handling, service mocking

### Playwright E2E Tests
- **Files**: `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`
- **Environment**: Real browsers
- **Use Cases**: Full user workflows
- **Advantages**: Real browser testing

## Key Scripts

```bash
# Run specific test types
bun run test:unit:logic        # Bun logic tests
bun run test:unit:components   # Vitest component tests
bun run test:integration       # Vitest integration tests
bun run test:e2e              # Playwright E2E tests

# Combined execution
bun run test:unit             # All unit tests
bun run test:all              # All test types
bun run test:coverage:all     # Full coverage with merge
```

## Coverage Strategy

1. **Separate Coverage Generation**
   - Each test runner generates its own coverage
   - Reports stored in dedicated directories

2. **Coverage Merge Process**
   - Uses nyc to merge lcov reports
   - Generates unified HTML and lcov reports
   - Validates against coverage thresholds

3. **Coverage Thresholds**
   - Logic tests: 85% (Bun)
   - Component tests: 75% (Vitest)
   - Integration tests: 70% (Vitest)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Performance**: Bun's fast execution for utility tests
2. **Compatibility**: Vitest handles React/JSX without issues
3. **Separation**: Clear boundaries between test types
4. **Flexibility**: Each test type uses optimal configuration
5. **Coverage**: Unified reporting across all test types

## Migration Notes

- Existing tests remain largely unchanged
- Mock API conversions handled in Bun setup
- Path aliases configured for all test runners
- Console mocking standardized across environments

## Future Enhancements

1. Add visual regression testing with Playwright
2. Implement mutation testing for critical paths
3. Add performance benchmarking for utilities
4. Enhance AI testing patterns for new models
