# E2E Test Health Report

## Current Status

### Test Count and Distribution
- **Total E2E Tests**: 84 tests (28 unique tests × 3 browsers)
- **Test Files**: 14 test files + 1 workflow execution test
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Test Framework**: Playwright 1.53.0

### Test Files Structure

## Configuration Analysis

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- **Test Directory**: `./tests/e2e`
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled (disabled on CI)
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Web Server**: Auto-starts dev server
- **Reporter**: HTML report

### Isolation from Other Test Types
E2E tests are properly isolated from unit and integration tests:

1. **Unit Tests (vitest.unit.config.ts)** - Excludes:
   - `**/*.e2e.test.*`
   - `tests/e2e/**`

2. **Integration Tests (vitest.integration.config.ts)** - Excludes:
   - `**/*.e2e.{test,spec}.*`
   - `**/e2e/**`

## Best Practices Observed

### 1. Test Organization
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated test directories
- Consistent naming convention (`.spec.ts` for E2E tests)
- Logical grouping of related tests

### 2. Test Structure
- Use of `test.describe` blocks for grouping
- Proper setup with `beforeEach` hooks
- Data-testid attributes for reliable element selection

### 3. Browser Coverage
- Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Ensures cross-browser compatibility

### 4. Advanced Testing Features
- AI-powered testing with Stagehand integration
- Visual regression testing
- Workflow execution testing
- Accessibility testing

### 5. Configuration Excellence
- Auto-start dev server before tests
- Reuse existing server when available
- Trace collection on test retry
- HTML reporting for better debugging

## Insights for Fixing Other Test Types

### 1. Clear Test Isolation
E2E tests succeed because they are:
- Completely isolated from other test runners
- Use a dedicated test framework (Playwright vs Vitest)
- Have their own configuration file

### 2. Proper Test Environment
- E2E tests run against a real server (`http://localhost:3000`)
- No module resolution issues as tests interact with the UI
- No TypeScript compilation conflicts

### 3. Dedicated Test Commands
- Clear, specific commands: `bun run test:e2e`
- Additional commands for different modes:
  - `test:e2e:headed` - Visual debugging
  - `test:e2e:debug` - Step debugging
  - `test:e2e:ai` - AI-powered tests only

### 4. Test Data Attributes
- Consistent use of `data-testid` for element selection
- Makes tests resilient to UI changes
- Clear intent in test code

## Recommendations for Unit/Integration Tests

Based on E2E test success, consider:

1. **Complete Isolation**: Create separate configurations with no overlap
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define what each test type should cover
3. **Dedicated Runners**: Use appropriate test runners for each type
4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure proper test environments
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Apply similar organization principles

## Coverage Reporting

Currently, E2E tests do not have coverage reporting configured. This is typical for E2E tests as they focus on user workflows rather than code coverage.

## Next Steps

1. Run full E2E test suite to verify current pass rate
2. Document any failing tests
3. Apply learnings to fix unit/integration test configurations
