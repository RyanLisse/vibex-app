## Current Issues

### Version Incompatibility

The main issue is Storybook version incompatibility:
- `storybook@9.0.17` (main package)
- `@storybook/addon-essentials@8.6.14` (incompatible)
- `@storybook/addon-interactions@8.6.14` (incompatible)
- `@storybook/test@8.6.14` (incompatible)

### Dependency Conflicts

Secondary issue is zod version conflicts:
- Project uses `zod@4.0.5`
- AI SDK packages expect `zod@^3.0.0`
- Blocking package installations

## Solutions Attempted

1. **Package Updates** - Tried to update addons to 9.0.17 (versions don't exist)
2. **Downgrade Approach** - Tried to downgrade main storybook (blocked by zod conflicts)
3. **Clean Install** - Tried fresh Storybook init (blocked by zod conflicts)
4. **Minimal Configuration** - Removed problematic addons for basic functionality

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Version Downgrade (Recommended)

Downgrade the main Storybook packages to 8.6.14 for compatibility:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps storybook@8.6.14 @storybook/nextjs@8.6.14 @storybook/addon-a11y@8.6.14
```

### Option 2: Zod Version Management

If keeping zod@4.0.5 is critical, use npm overrides in package.json:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "zod": "4.0.5"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Wait for Storybook 9.1

Storybook 9.1 may resolve the addon compatibility issues. Monitor:

## Testing

Once version issues are resolved, test with:

```bash
npm run storybook
npm run build-storybook
npm run test-storybook
```

## Notes

- All story files are properly structured for Storybook 9.x
- Configuration supports Next.js integration
- Theme switching is implemented
- Accessibility addon is configured
- TypeScript support is properly configured
